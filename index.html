        <h3>Waste Segregation Machine</h3>
        <p>The management of waste is a critical issue in today's world, as it has a significant impact on the
            environment. In this context, a waste segregating machine that can efficiently segregate dry and wet
            waste can prove to be an innovative solution. This project aims to develop a waste segregating
            machine that utilizes Arduino, Aluminium foil as a moisture sensor, and IR sensor to detect waste. The proposed machine employs an Arduino micro-controller that receives input from the
            Aluminium foil regarding the moisture content of the waste in the form of capacitance and IR sensor
            to detect waste. The waste is segregated into two separate sections, dry and wet, to facilitate the
            recycling process. The system is designed to be low-cost, compact, and user-friendly. The use of Arduino ensures that
            the machine can be easily programmed and updated. The Aluminium foil sensor, used to detect the
            moisture content of the waste, can be circumscribed in terms of the moisture level. The machine can
            handle a wide range of waste types, making it versatile and suitable for use in a variety of settings. 
            In summary, This machine can help manage waste more effectively, reduce the environmental
            impact, and facilitate the recycling process.</p>

        <h3>Research Paper</h3>
        <p>There are multiple algorithms available to recognize Marathi Devnagari characters. Most of these methods are limited because of the large variety of character variations due to Kana, Matra, Ukar, Velanti, and Anusvar, which are specific to the Marathi grammar called Barakhadi. There is a need to have a dictionary-based word formulation to achieve full Marathi sentence recognition. In the proposed work, a Marathi sentence is recognized using a combination of full 454 variation detection of Devnagari characters and nearest dictionary word mapping using the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) model to achieve full sentence recognition. This is the first time full 454 (Vyanjan variation as per Barakhadi) character recognition instead of the traditional 58 characters (Vyanjans) has been attempted which leads to sentence recognition. The proposed method could achieve a sentence recognition accuracy of 86.84%, a 454 character classification accuracy was 89.52%, and the execution speed of the proposed system was 1.464 secs per word. For the training of the character recognition network, a separate dataset was created for all Vyanjan variations as per Barakhadi. This novel contribution of the proposed system will surely inspire researchers to explore Devnagari sentence recognition.</p>

        <h3>Fake Social Media Profile Detection</h3>
        <p>We are presenting a comprehensive methodology leveraging machine learning to detect pseudo-social media profiles, thereby contributing to the enhancement of security and sustainability in data centers through energy-efficient solutions. Our approach involves the utilization of a classification algorithm, incorporating features such as followers count, friends count, geo-enabled status, and account metadata to discern between genuine and potentially deceptive accounts. Through extensive testing on a diverse dataset spanning various social media platforms, our model demonstrates its efficacy in accurately identifying pseudo-accounts. This system, developed with a focus on energy-efficient solutions, serves as a valuable tool for platforms to mitigate the impact of deceptive accounts, ultimately fostering the overall integrity and trustworthiness of online social spaces and contributing to the sustainability of data centers.</p>

        <h3>Stray Animal Recognition System</h3>
        <p>The presence of stray animals, particularly dogs and cats, poses significant challenges within communities, including concerns related to animal welfare, public health risks, and safety hazards. Addressing these challenges requires innovative solutions that leverage advancements in technology. Motivated by the urgency to improve the well-being of stray animals and enhance community safety, this project focuses on developing a real-time detection system using deep learning technology. Specifically, the project utilizes the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) algorithm to analyze video footage and identify stray dogs and cats in public spaces. The system aims to minimize false positives and trigger timely alerts to notify local authorities about the presence and location of stray animals. By prioritizing ethical considerations and concentrating solely on public spaces and the identification of dogs and cats, this project lays the groundwork for responsible stray animal management. The outcomes of this project demonstrate the potential of deep learning technology to contribute to more efficient and effective intervention efforts in communities, ultimately leading to safer and healthier environments for both humans and animals.</p>
